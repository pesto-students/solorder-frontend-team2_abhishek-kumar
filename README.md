Solorder is an online food ordering website which helps restaurants, home kitchens, cloud kitchens and etc get their orders without giving any commission for the orders they receive online. This website is for those who use their own delivery person to deliver their items. Due to this owner can make more profit on each order and the customer gets the food items at a low price. Orders get delivered to customers faster because the owner uses their own delivery person.

<br/>

What is the difference between Solorder and Swiggy or Zomato?

-   Other websites like Swiggy or Zomato take a major part of the profit as commissions due to this the item's cost online is higher compared to offline.
    
-   Due to this many of the restaurant owners have started taking online orders either through phone or by other online ways (Like WhatsApp, Instagram and etc), they also keep their own delivery person to deliver their online orders.
    
-   Here Solorder comes into play, it will provide a common platform for such owners so they can list their menus online and get their orders without thinking about how.
    
-   In Solorder, owners can buy a one-time subscription and can list its menu on our website.
    
-   Customers can place online orders that owners will deliver to them, so no commission system.

# Technology Stack

  

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

  

- [Mui](https://mui.com//)

- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

- [Razorpay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/razorpay)
